(*Should I do the interpretation for showing that Perm is a group? How does interpretation works?*)

(*This formalization is based on https://lawrencecpaulson.github.io/2022/03/23/Locales.html and https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Jacobson_Basic_Algebra.html*)

(*Since we want to give examples of the structures we are going to work, like naturals and integers,
we need to import Main. But groups and monoids are already defined in Main. Thus, we need to give it
another name.*)

(*Remember that infixl tells us that we should parse the strings by the left. So x \<cdot> y \<cdot> z is parsed as (x\<cdot>y)\<cdot>z*)
(* "70" tells us the priority of \<cdot> relative to others symbols*)

(*Another possible way of defining a group is:*)
locale gggroup = mmonoid G "(\<cdot>)" \<e>

the locale as we called the mmonoids. Doing this, we will have something like it is done in the
